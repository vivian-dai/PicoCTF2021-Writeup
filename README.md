# PicoCTF2021-Writeup

For the sole purpose of proving people did stuff.

On a side note... these are the writeups for the few questions we managed to complete.

Side note x2: I don't think my team mates are going to add to this anymore but I'm going to also add in the questions that got solved *after* pico ended and be sad about the simplicity of some of them *cough* milk. Everything before [this commit](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/commit/f6cacbebed610f80202bca05bcf10650cca189db) was solved before pico ended (if it matters)
